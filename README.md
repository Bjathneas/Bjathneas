# Howdy, I'm Benajah
I make stuff

I spend my days learning Data Structures, Algoritms, Programming Languages, CyberSecurity, etc.
I also am working on getting Security+, after I finish my Network+ course.

## Why am I making Repositories
As I develop each project, I am actively **learning** and revising my code to be more and more efficient.
With each repo I create, I aim to create an easy to use library/program with efficient and useful algoritms

## Repos to Checkout
I develop many kinds of libraries and programs that you could checkout!
* [**EnCore**](https://github.com/Bjathneas/EnCore): An Entity Component System Library
* [**WFC**](https://github.com/Bjathneas/WFC): My solution to a Word Frequency Challenge by chatGPT
* [**CPP_Challenges**](https://github.com/Bjathneas/CPP_Challenges): A PR of my c++ solutions to different programming challenges
